# TSP_Using_Genetic_Algorithm

Genetic algorithm (GA) is a search technique used in computer science to 
find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization 
problems. 


A genetic algorithm can be used to find a solution in
much less time. Although it might not find the best 
solution, it can find a nearly perfect solution for 100 city 
tour in less than a minute.
